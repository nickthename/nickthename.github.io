There are two main ways to play *Smash*: in-person using an N64 console, or online using an emulator program on PC.

### In-Person

To play on console, you'll need an N64, a copy of the game, and a controller.
- Consoles can be found on Craigslist, eBay, or FB marketplace. Some may come without power or video cables; third party replacements for these are cheap and fine.
- The game cartridge can be obtained second-hand the same way as a console, and a standard Super Smash Bros. cartridge is all you need to play. Many players opt to use an [Everdrive]() or equivalent instead, which can hold any number of N64 games and makes it possible to play mods like 19XX on console.
- There are a ton of possible controller options, see the [controller guide]() for details. Original N64 controllers work fine, but you may want to [lubricate the stick](/guides/controllers.html#lubricants) to help reduce wear.

You can find a list of upcoming tournaments on [supersmashbros.org](https://supersmashbros.org/), and ask around for people in your area on the SSB64 [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Smash64Community/) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/ssb64) groups.

### Online

To play on emulator, all you'll need is a computer or phone. The most popular way to play is by using the [Project 64KSE](https://smash64.online/) netplay emulator, which makes it possible to play over the internet!

To use an N64 controller you'll want a [Raphnet N64 to USB adapter](https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/dual_n64_to_usb_adapter/index.php); you can also use keyboard or any USB controller. Online play requires a windows PC with an ethernet connection, but there are local emulators available for almost every platform.
